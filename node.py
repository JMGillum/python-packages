    This node class is a child class of Tree, meaning that it is basically
    a tree that can store its own data on top of having (optional) children.
    It also features improved str casting, as it can store a function to call
    whenever it is cast to string.

    This class is best used when the stored data has child data as well, or
    just if the data is too much/complex to just be stored as the name of the
    tree.
